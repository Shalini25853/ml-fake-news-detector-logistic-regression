A logistic regression model using TF-IDF to classify fake vs real news headlines, with 93.9% accuracy. Includes model evaluation and future enhancement recommendations.
# Fake News Detection using Logistic Regression

This project implements a **logistic regression classifier** to detect fake news headlines using **TF-IDF vectorization** and binary classification techniques. The model is designed for integration into real-time mobile or web applications to help users assess the credibility of online articles.

---

##  Problem Statement

Misinformation spreads rapidly through platforms like Twitter/X, influencing public opinion and markets. This model aims to classify whether a news headline is *real* or *fake*, giving users a confidence score to support their decision-making.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Pandas / NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Methodology

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
   - TF-IDF feature extraction

2. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression (binary classifier)
   - 80/20 train-test split

3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy: **93.9%**
   - Confusion matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score

---

##  Results

- **High Precision**: Effectively minimizes false positives
- **Challenge**: Model struggles slightly with subtle false negatives
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows strong performance on both real and fake cases

---

##  Limitations & Future Work

- TF-IDF lacks semantic understanding — future work can explore:
  - BERT or transformer-based embeddings
  - Hybrid models (ensemble learning)
  - Fact-checking API integration
  - User feedback loop for continuous learning

---

## Business Impact

This tool can be embedded into **social media platforms**, **news aggregation apps**, or **browser extensions** to reduce the spread of fake news and improve digital literacy.
